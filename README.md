This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Love Islane

This timed project was aimed to test knowledge of `fetch` posts using `GET` `POST` and `DELETE` 
This project loads in staff data from a local server api, and adds them as contestant cards where the user can view all their details, love them, or skip them. Skip them runs a `DELETE` request and removes them from the local api server. The Love them's goal was to update the css to signify a new color. 

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
